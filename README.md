#2 Timetable Generator Task:

Objective:
Write a detailed and comprehensive prompt to prepare a timetable for a student.
Task Details:
Design a detailed prompt to create personalized study plans for students. You have access
to a range of information about each student. The prompt should direct the LLM to
thoroughly analyze the diverse array of student-specific data, encompassing their subjects

and academic performance across different subjects, preferred learning styles (visual,
auditory, kinesthetic), extracurricular activities, and distinct personal objectives or challenges
(such as preparing for a specific exam or overcoming a learning difficulty). The prompt
should be well-structured to ensure that the LLM synthesizes this information to create a
study plan that not only addresses academic requirements but also aligns with each
student's unique needs and aspirations. Highlight how you would structure the prompt to
ensure all-inclusive and individualized plans are generated.
Make sure that the prompt caters to each studentâ€™s specific needs.
